      letâ€™s be honest, reading documentation is not something that most of us
      enjoy, but when working with a modern front-end framework like Vue, which
      is constantly evolving, a lot of things change with every new release and
      you might have missed some of the new and shiny features that were later
      introduced. Let's take a look at those interesting but not so popular

      documentation.
